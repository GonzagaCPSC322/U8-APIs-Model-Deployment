    "## Introduction to APIs\n",
    "Suppose your app needs to get some data from the web, such as real-time weather data. Here are a couple of ways to go about this\n",
    "* Web scraping: download the HTML from a weather website and scrape it for the information you are looking for\n",
    "    * Sometimes not ethical to do, check with the site first before doing this\n",
    "* Use an API (application programming interface): write code to make requests to download data, query status, compute something, etc.\n",
    "    * This is what sites want you to use to get their information\n",
    "* An API provides functions for programmers to use, without needing to know the details of the implementation\n",
    "* APIs are a great way to get historical and real-time data to analyze and combine to form larger datasets\n",
    "* Web-based APIs are available for tons of major services!\n",
    "    * Topics: Weather, news, traffic, fitness, etc.\n",
    "        * E.g. http://openweathermap.com/api \n",
    "    * Companies: Google Maps, Twitter, Spotify, etc.\n",
    "    * Some are unauthenticated, some are authenticated\n",
    "        * Check out this repo of public APIs that are labeled with their authentication requirements: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis \n",
    "* Information passed between websites is usually XML or JSON\n",
    "    * Responses to API requests are usually in JSON format\n",
    "    * Here is a high live diagram showing how requests and responses work (from udemy.com):\n",

    "## URL Requests\n",
    "* You can write a client app/program that leverages the HTTP infrastructure to talk to a web-enabled server\n",
    "    * Server side of this app is a web service\n",
    "    * Your client app and the web service can exchange requests and responses via HTTP\n",
    "* Data is usually passed around the web in JSON or XML format\n",
    "    * Note: if you control the web server and the client, you can use any format you like, otherwise you have to use whatever the server supports\n",
    "* Communication with servers is done via requests\n",
    "    * A request encapsulates information about the interaction between the app and the server\n",
    "    * A request has a url that stores parameters of the request\n",
    "    * Here is nice diagram from Apple that describes the different parts of a url\n",

    "* There are different types of [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods). The most commonly used types for working with APIs are\n",
    "    * GET: \"The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.\"\n",
    "    * POST: \"The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.\"\n",
    "    * PUT: \"The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.\"\n",
    "    * DELETE: \"The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.\"\n",
    "* The format varies depending on the server that the request is reaching out to\n",
    "    * Read the documentation\n",
    "* Example: downloading images and image metadata via the Flickr interesting photos API\n",
    "    * Web service is hosted at  https://api.flickr.com/services/rest\n",
    "    * Query items (key value pairs) are supplied as part of the request URL\n",
    "        * method: which endpoint you want to hit on the Flickr API\n",
    "            * For interesting photos, this is \"flickr.interestingness.getList\"\n",
    "            * We will be making a GET request to \"get\" interesting photos\n",
    "        * api_key: key that Flickr generates to authorize an application to use the Flickr API\n",
    "            * Note: it is not good practice to store your API key in your code!! If we do in class it is for the sake of time and brevity. One option for more securely storing it is to store it in a separate txt that is in your .gitignore (so it does not end up on Github)\n",
    "        * extras: attributes passed in to customize the response\n",
    "        * format: specifies that you want the payloud coming back to be JSON\n",
    "        * nojsoncallback: specifies that you want JSON back in its raw format\n",
    "    * Data that is returned will be in JSON format\n",
